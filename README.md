# RespiroCare
## SoundAI Submission by NeuralMinds
Lung disease detection using a voice recording of breathing sounds. By breathing into the microphone our model predicts if you have a respiratory disease. Our model was trained on a stethoscopic lung sounds dataset using LinerAI

Record your own breath and check it out!

You can run and test on our Streamlit demo website [here](https://soundaineuralminds-axdaapqrdviflunycyjyzg.streamlit.app/) or by downloading the files in [Demo_python_app](https://github.com/Mohamad-Atif1/Sound_ai_neural_minds/tree/master/Demo_python_app) and running the code locally (Use the command `streamlit run app.py`)
